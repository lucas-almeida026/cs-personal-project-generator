# Computer Science Personal Project Backlog Generator

### Use local llama model to create backlog of tasks for a personal project assuming you are a computer science student

---

This project makes a couple of assumptions about the dev environment:
- yuu have node installed
- you use ollama to run the local model
- you rely strictly on system prompts to steer the model
- you think HTMX is far superior to React in 99% of cases üòè

Ps: the models respond using a cumbersome format that I had to write a parser for (tbf, it was just an excuse to create _yet another_ parser)
